```
$ mkdir SimpleStorage
$ cd SimpleStorage
```
Now your are in the working directory ```SimpleStorage/```, a simple command will initialize your project:

```

```
.

│   └── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
│   └── 1_initial_migration.js

└── truffle.js
```

# Create your contract

In the ```contracts/``` directory, create your contract file "Store.sol", which you can find it [here]{https://github.com/rszheng/truffle-exercises/blob/master/SimpleStorage/contracts/Store.sol}.

# Prepare for deploying

# Deploy your contract
